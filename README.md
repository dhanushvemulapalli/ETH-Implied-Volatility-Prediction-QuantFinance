# ETH-Implied-Volatility-Prediction-QuantFinance
Developed a forecasting model to forecast 10-second-ahead implied volatility for Cyptocurrency Trading.

This notebook is designed for a Kaggle competition & a hiring assigment where the goal is to predict short-term price movements for ETH using order book data. The training set contains ETH-specific features and labels, while BTC and SOL order book datasets are provided for cross-asset feature engineering to improve predictive performance. We focus on building a memory-efficient, feature-rich pipeline that leverages all available ETH data and integrates BTC/SOL features without exceeding Kaggleâ€™s hardware limits.
